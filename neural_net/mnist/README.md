    - http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/)
    - http://opensourc.es/blog/tensorflow-mnist by Ole Kr√∂ger. This material was mostly used for the conv_image.ipynb notebook, where I preprocess a 'handwritten' image written in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
